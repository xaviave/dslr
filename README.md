   - An scatter plot: `python3 scatter_plot.py`
   - An pair plot: `python3 pair_plot.py`

## Logistic regression

The main part:
   - the logistic regression trainer file `logreg_train.py`, that will generate a file with the predicition from the gradient descent
   - the predict program `logreg_predict.py` that take the file generate previously and predict every house form the dataset given
